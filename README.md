- Context-aware responses

### LangGraph Workflows
- Function chaining and workflow orchestration
- LLM integration with Groq API
- Document processing pipelines
- Vector database integration with Chroma

## üìä Usage Examples

### Sentiment Analysis
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Default sentiment analysis
sentiment_model = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = sentiment_model("This movie is amazing!")

# Twitter-specific sentiment
twitter_model = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", 
                        model="cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest")
```

### Translation
```python
# English to French translation
translator = pipeline("translation_en_to_fr", model="google-t5/t5-small")
translated = translator("Hello, how are you?")
```

### LangGraph Workflow
```python
from langgraph.graph import Graph

# Create a simple workflow
workflow = Graph()
workflow.add_node("process", your_function)
workflow.set_entry_point("process")
app = workflow.compile()
```
